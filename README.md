This repository provides a starting point for building Angular applications with Tailwind CSS. Angular is a popular framework for building dynamic web applications, and Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to create responsive and customizable designs with ease.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Angular CLI

## Usage
```python
## Development server
Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
